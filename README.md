#angularjs-xchglab

## Introduction

This repository hosts a Xchg [$resource](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource) adapter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). 

This is a small wrapper around the AngularJS $resource that will make setting up and working with api.xchg.com easy. 

## api.xchg.com

This is a python/flask api currently being developed and residing at exi.xchg.com.

Currently, this project is being used as a sandbox for wiring up AngularJS to talk to a Python/Flask API currently residing at exi.xchg.com.


## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:LarryEitel/angular-xchglab.git
    cd angular-xchglab
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    Hit: http://localhost:8000/

## Testing

Recently revisiting AngularJS. Need to write a few simple mocks and tests.
